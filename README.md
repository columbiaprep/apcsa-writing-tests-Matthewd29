# CGPS Adventure Game

## Lab 3.2: Creating Interfaces and Abstract Classes

### Overview
Students will have to add and modify existing classes to create the structure of our Adventure game.

### Tasks
Using the UML diagram, create interfaces and abstract classes as specified. 

Add any method headers for existing classes as needed. Go sequentially through each class in the diagram, ensuring everything matches.

Remove the additional functionality from MeleeWeapon and RangedWeapon. We will discuss how to connect the two classes during our lesson today (12/12/24).

## Grading

The rubric will be based on the same criteria as last time:
- Adding in new classes
- Modifying existing classes
- Keeping code organized and neat
- Adding in comments to explain each class
